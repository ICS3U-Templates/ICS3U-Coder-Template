# ICS3U Coder Template
A Coder template for ICS3U, with Python &amp; C as the programming languages.

## Adding in C/C++ Extension
The standard C/C++ Microsoft extension is not available due to liesence issues in the open-vsx.org registry. Instead use this link (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) to download the latest version, move it into your Coder IDE and then isntall the extension. You will also want to create a ".vscode" folder (at the root of the dev enviroment) and place both the c_cpp_properties.json and tasks.json files inside them. You will then be able to not only compile but also debug C/C++ code. (See the .vscode folder in this repository).
